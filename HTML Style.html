    <p style="text-align: center;">This is the story about the student life. It gives a moral lesson to all fun-loving students who 
    spend their valuable time in enjoying parties, movies, etc and not serious in studies because 
    every moment of student life is valuable and time must be utilized by the students in regular 
    studies . Now-a-days, students think that student life is very easy and full of fun today 
    especially college life of the students. But the future of students depend upon their 
	achievements in student life because the fun-loving students of today used smart ways to get 
	good marks in examination</p>

	<p>WWF's mission is to stop the <strong>degradation</strong> of our planet's natural environment</p>
